        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_azuredevops as azuredevops

        project = azuredevops.core.Project("project", project_name="Test Project")
        user = azuredevops.entitlement.User("user", principal_name="foo@contoso.com")
        group = project.id.apply(lambda id: azuredevops.Identities.get_group(project_id=id,
            name="Build Administrators"))
        membership = azuredevops.identities.GroupMembership("membership",
            group=group.descriptor,
            members=[user.descriptor])
