 * import * as azuredevops from "@pulumi/azuredevops";
 *
 * const project = new azuredevops.Project("project", {});
 * const user = new azuredevops.User("user", {principalName: "foo@contoso.com"});
 * const group = project.id.apply(id => azuredevops.getGroup({
 *     projectId: id,
 *     name: "Build Administrators",
 * }));
 * const membership = new azuredevops.GroupMembership("membership", {
 *     group: group.descriptor,
 *     members: [user.descriptor],
 * });
