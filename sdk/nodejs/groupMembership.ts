 *
 * const exampleProject = new azuredevops.Project("example", {name: "Example Project"});
 * const exampleUser = new azuredevops.User("example", {principalName: "foo@contoso.com"});
 * const example = azuredevops.getGroupOutput({
 *     projectId: exampleProject.id,
 *     name: "Build Administrators",
 * });
 * const exampleGroupMembership = new azuredevops.GroupMembership("example", {
 *     group: example.apply(example => example.descriptor),
 *     members: [exampleUser.descriptor],
 * });
 * ```
